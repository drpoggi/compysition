    Simple module that is designed to accept any input and replicate it to any outbox(s)
    For example, if one were to want to abstract multiple potential data flows to a single aggregator (EventMatcher) inbox, the outbox behind
    this FlowController module would serve as a mask so that the data aggregator isn't waiting for data flow channels that will never arrive

    In the future this could be designed to handle multiple functions, such as controlling rate of event flow through it
